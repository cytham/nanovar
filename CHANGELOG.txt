    * Fixed cython compilation bug (Thanks to Scott, https://github.com/cytham/nanovar/issues/5#issuecomment-592766203)
    * Updated requirements.txt


Version 1.3.0 - Feb 28, 2020
    * Tool requirement changes:
        * Added SAMTools
        * Added Minimap2

    * Algorithm and pipeline changes:
        * NanoVar now uses both minimap2 and hs-blastn for increased sensitivity
        * Upgraded model (v5)
        * Improved time complexity for clustering algorithm
        * Minor tuning of SV confidence scores by normal read coverage and number of alignments
        * Default SV read support -c changed from 1 to 2
        * Added progress information command-line feed during the run.

    * Input/Ouput changes:
        * NanoVar can now take a BAM file (tested BAM from minimap2) as input instead of FASTQ/FASTA reads
        * Added ONT/PacBio option (For future use, currently both tech uses same model)
        * Added custom model option
        * Added --debug option
        * Added Minimap2 executable path option
        * Added SAMTools executable path option

    * VCF format changes:
        * "END" coordinate for BND SVs will now show POS+1 coordinate instead of "." to be usable for IGV (Thanks to Scott,
