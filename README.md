NanoVar is a genomic structural variant (SV) caller that utilizes low-depth long-read sequencing such as
 Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). It characterizes SVs with using only 4x depth
  sequencing for homozygous SVs and 8x depth for heterozygous SVs.

### Basic capabilities
* Performs long-read mapping (Minimap2) and SV discovery in a single pipeline.
* Accurately characterizes SVs using long sequencing reads (High SV recall and precision in simulation datasets, overall F1
 score >0.9)  
* Characterizes six classes of SVs including novel-sequence insertion, deletion, inversion, tandem duplication, sequence
 transposition (TPO) and translocation (TRA).  
* Requires 4x and 8x sequencing depth for detecting homozygous and heterozygous SVs respectively.  
* Rapid computational speed (Takes <3 hours to map and analyze 12 gigabases datasets (4x) using 24 CPU threads)  
* Approximates SV genotype
* Identifies full-length LINE and SINE insertions (Marked by "TE=" in the INFO column of VCF file)
* Repeat element INS annotation using [NanoINSight](https://github.com/AsmaaSamyMohamedMahmoud/NanoINSight)
<!--

## Annotating INS variants with NanoINSight
NanoVar allows the concurrent repeat element annotation of INS variants using [NanoINSight](https://github.com/AsmaaSamyMohamedMahmoud/NanoINSight).

To run NanoINSight, simply add "--annotate_ins [species]" when running NanoVar.
```
nanovar -t 24 -f hg38 --annotate_ins human sample.bam ref.fa working_dir
```
To understand NanoINSight output files, please visit its repository [here](https://github.com/AsmaaSamyMohamedMahmoud/NanoINSight).

### Installation of NanoINSight dependencies

NanoINSight requires the installation of MAFFT and RepeatMasker. Please refer to [here](https://github.com/AsmaaSamyMohamedMahmoud/NanoINSight) for instructions on how to install them, or install them through Conda as shown below:

## Simulation datasets and scripts used in the manuscript
SV simulation datasets used in the manuscript can be downloaded [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3569479). Scripts used for simulation dataset generation and tool performance comparison are available [here](./scripts).

Although NanoVar is provided with a universal model and threshold score, instructions required for building a custom neural-network model is available [here](https://github.com/cytham/nanovar/wiki/Model-training).

## Limitations
* The inaccurate basecalling of large homopolymer or low complexity DNA regions may result in the false determination of deletion SVs. We advise the use of up-to-date ONT basecallers such as [Dorado](https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado) to minimize this possibility.

* For BND SVs, NanoVar is unable to calculate the actual number of SV-opposing reads (normal reads) at the novel adjacency as
 there are two breakends from distant locations. It is not clear whether the novel adjacency is derived from both or either
  breakends in cases of balanced and unbalanced variants, and therefore it is not possible to know which breakend location(s) to
   consider for counting normal reads. Currently, NanoVar approximates the normal read count by the minimum count from either 
   breakend location. Although this helps in capturing unbalanced BNDs, it might lead to some false positives.
